The repo contains the source code for the [Making Python 100x faster with less than 100 lines of Rust](https://ohadravid.github.io/posts/2023-03-rusty-python/) blog post (there's a [copy](./rusty_python.md) in this repo as well).

It's a demo library in Python that we can converts parts of to Rust, to improve its performance.

Here's a table summarizing the perf gains:

| Version                                                      | Avg time per iteration (ms)  | Multiplier | 
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------|
| v1 - Baseline implementation (Python)                        | 293.41                       | 1x         |
| v2 - Naive line-to-line translation of `find_close_polygons` | 23.44                        | 12.50x     |
| v3 - `Polygon` implementation in Rust                        | 6.29                         | 46.53x     |
| v4 - Optimized allocations                                   | 2.90                         | 101.16x    |
| v5 - Move outer loop to Rust (*)                             | 0.81                         | 362.23x    |

(*) v5 was added after the post was published, showing how to reduce Python to Rust overhead even more.

There are also two versions which use "vectorizing" (doing more of the work directly in numpy).
While not applicable to the original library, they also show major performance gains:

| Version                                                      | Avg time per iteration (ms)  | Multiplier | 
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------|
| v1 - Baseline implementation (Python)                        | 293.41                       | 1x         |
| v1.5 - A bit of `numpy` vectorization                        | 41.79                        | 7.02x      |
| v1.6 - A lot of `numpy` vectorization, by @dangrie158        | 5.18                         | 56.68x     |


## Setup

The code should work on all supported platforms (Python & Rust),
but `--native` profiling is only supported by `py-spy` on x86 Linux and Windows.

(macOS / Arm Linux can still generate profiles viewing just the Python code.)

For example, to setup with conda, run:

```bash
conda install numpy pytest
```

Then install `py-spy`:

```bash
pip install py-spy
```

For the complete Rust setup, you'll need Rust (use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)) and to also `pip install maturin`.

To build the native extension, run:

```bash
(cd poly_match_rs && maturin develop --release)
```

## Exploring more optimizations

There are a few more optimizations we can try.

For example, we could use `(dx^2 + dy^2) < dist^2` (calculating `dist^2` only once, saving a `sqrt`).
According to the profiler outputs, can we expect this to make a big difference?

We could build a Rust bench using [criterion](https://github.com/bheisler/criterion.rs),
which would require us to "split" the Python & pure-Rust parts (Maybe using `AsRef<Polygon>`).

We could also try to convert the list of Polygons only once to Rust at the start of the run.
According to the profiler outputs, can we expect this to make a big difference? (See `v5`)
